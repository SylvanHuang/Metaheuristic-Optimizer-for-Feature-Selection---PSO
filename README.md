# Metaheuristic Optimizer for Feature Selection - PSO

The optimistic feature selection methodology which is used for feature selection process along with the performance, based  on the real time applications

The research works are carried out as Master Thesis in the university TU-Chemnitz, Germany.

# Classification Function

We can call any type of classifier wrt to machine learning classifiers such as SVM, DT, KNN, LDA, CNN, etc.

In order to check the performance on real time scenarios, we can use benchmark modal functions to verify the optimizer performance.

# Initialization

It enables us to assign the no. of search agents which help in searching the points of best solution in the given search space.

# Function plots

This code gives the resultant plot for a series of seaeching points in the search space and best possible outcomes for a series of operations carried out.
